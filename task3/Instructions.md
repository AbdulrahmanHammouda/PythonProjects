## In my task i did my best with handeling all the cases so hopfully it won't crash no matter what order we fully.

## To get the desired outcome simply follow these steps.

1. Upload Image one
2. Upload image two and make sure its the same size, or it won't load it, if you chose only one picture, the picture 2 choice in the mixer will be disabled.
3. Choose your output
4. Choose component one and what do you want to take from it (Mag,Phase,etc)
5. Choose component two acoording to one as the program will block some options. For example the user can't choose magnitude with imaginary
6. The output will be shown 
7. If you want the second out put , simply choose output two and have fun!
